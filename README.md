This project is for Applying my knowledge Test-Driven development workFlow and Protocol-Oriented programming, from these books:

1- [Swift Protocol-Oriented Programming-4th Edition(2019)](https://www.packtpub.com/product/swift-protocol-oriented-programming-fourth-edition/9781789349023)
2- [Test-driven iOS development with Swift 4 (2017)](Test-Driven iOS Development with Swift 4 - Third Edition)

It is an example for seperating layers for the purpose of reaching a maintainable & extendable software, with the help of TDD workflow.

# Topics Learned from these Books:
1- Test-Driven development, it is about starting the code from the test to understand the requirements: 
  - you start to write the test
  - write the minimal code to make the test compiles, you get a failing test (Red)
  - write the code to make the test pass (green)
  - refactor code to make it better (Refactor)
  Red -> Green -> Refactor, these are the steps of TDD.

2- Protocol-oriented programming, It is a way of structuring your code to make a codebase easy to maintain & extend:
  - start the design with a protocol to define the blueprints for the common methods.
